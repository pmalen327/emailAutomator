# emailAutomator
Automates the sending of an email in python. I would not recommend storing your password like this, I basically used it as a placeholder. There are better, more secure ways to fetch your login info. I use Windows task scheduler to make this run at my desired date/time. So when the date/time parameters are met, it will find main.py and execute it with my python.exe. Nothing crazy going on here, but was a fun little project to figure out and actually pretty practical.
